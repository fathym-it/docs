**Fathym saves you time** by doing the heavy lifting of backend infrastructure and application management so that you don't need to spend time and resources to "level up" and become an expert cloud architect.  

We provide everything you need to deliver your next cloud-native solution.  Start from scratch with out-of-the box functionality, or select the features you need.  Leverage the Fathym Framework to establish your enterprise best practices and deliver solutions with your existing technology skills.

Are you an expert cloud architect?  See how our tools can support you in establishing your own [best practices and automation](../../developers/infrastructure)

## Best Practices

At its core, Fathym Framework embraces a technology agnostic approach to its orchestration tools.  Technology is vast, and our chosen languages and frameworks should work together to deliver cohesive solutions across seemingly disparate tech stacks.  We'll help you establish your enterprise best practices in a way that streamlines development while leveraging your existing tech skillsets.  

Our team best practices lean towards Azure, C#, and TypeScript/Angular, but we recognize that every team is different.  Our framework will help you establish best practices and ensure them across infrastructure, devops, and application development decisions.  Whether delivering innovative, startup technology or proven legacy solutions, Fathym Framework will support your team in adopting and establishing best practices in a hybrid-cloud world.

## Community Open Source

We believe it is important to provide valuable solutions and contributions to open source projects.  On top of open sourcing most of our technology, we believe in adopting and supporting other existing open source projects.  We know we don't have all the answers, and by working with different communities we can achieve more.  Sharing knowledge is the purpose of open source, and we hope to make more of that knowledge accesible to more users.

## Low Code Units (LCUs)

In order to bring greater trust and flexibility to the open source code we use, Fathym suggests development of community driven LCUs that can be orchestrated to achieve dynamic product solutions.  It is a semantic architecture and approach for building reusable micro-frontends and micro-services with base SDKs for developing your own LCUs (currently only available in TypeScript/Angular and C#).

LCUs allow you to build your frontend components in a reusable way, in the languages you prefer, and then easily upgrade, manage and even migrate frameworks.  We embrace component driven, state-based, atomic reusability in LCUs, read more on [LCU](../../developers/applications/low-code-units) and [micro-frontend](../../developers/applications/micro-frontends) capabilities.

## Virtual Developers

Different than most low code/no code platforms, Fathym helps you develop repeatable automation on your own chosen technology stack.  You can program virtual developers that deliver the tech you choose, in a repeatable, migratable, and scalable way.  Enable Jr and Mid level devs to deliver with Sr dev quality, even enabling non-development employment roles to accomplish complex development / technology tasks.

## No Vendor Lock-In

Our virtual developers are always helping your team develop code under enterprise best practice standards, not just locking your best practices away in our config.  Most of the code, solutions and components you use have no vendor lock-in.  Read more on [no vendor lock-in](../../developers/no-vendor-lock-in)
