The Fathym Framework is focused on helping you take charge of your clouds, applications, and deployment strategies.  It enables developers to rapidly build data-driven applications by applying best practice workflows for cloud infrastructure automation and application management. 

In this getting started guide, we'll walk you through creating an automated, enterprise-grade, Azure-hosted environment with just a few clicks.  We'll setup the following to get you started:

- Infrastructure
  - Enterprise-scalable, cost-effective Azure cloud
  - Manage clouds, and legacy infrastructure with enterprise orchestration tools
- DevOps
  - Connects with your Azure DevOps instance and assists managing your code, builds, releases, and more
  - Sets up Git-based source control for your infrastructure and connect it to builds for auto-deploying to Azure
- Applications
  - Secured application hosts with Let's Encrypt

For setups that would like a hybrid-cloud without Azure connectivity, please visit [Starting without Azure](guides/starting-without-azure)

## Fathym Account Creation

**Fathym saves you time.** Fathym does the heavy lifting of backend infrastructure and workflow automation so that you don't need to spend time and resources to "level up" and become an expert cloud architect.

After registering for a [Starter or Pro](https://www.fathym-it.com/billing/lcu) package, you can let Fathym do the heavy lifting to:

- Provision an enterprise scalable cloud on your Azure
- Provide best practices in building essential data flows and cloud storage
- Automate DevOp operations with application release/deployment and version management
- Maximize reusability and save time in data application development

Are you an expert cloud architect?  See how our tools can support you in establishing your own [best practices and automation](developers/infrastructure)

### Automating a Best Practice Environment

With Fathym, you can quickly and easily set up a best practice cloud infrastructure environment..  Here you'll be able to deploy the tools and solutions of your choosing, like our application orchestration and data flow management LCUs. With just a few clicks, Fathym sets you up a cloud-native enable Azure cloud environment, so it is always accessible and always yours.

Fathym offers two infrastructure template options. The Low Code Unit Runtime Template installs the Azure resources that are required to run the Fathym Low-Code Framework and host, manage and deploy applications and APIs. The Low Code Unit Runtime Template w/ IoT installs all the above and will provision the infrastructure to connect devices and real-time data flows, enabling IoT projects. This includes the initial best practice data flow resources, like an IoT Hub, Event Hub, Cold Storage, Warm Storage, and Hot Storage.

Having selected the infrastructure template that is right for you, in 15 minutes or less Fathym will automate your enterpriseâ€“ready cloud environment while you kick back and have a beer.

The video below compares configuring these resources in Fathym versus the Azure portal, which is tedious and time consuming for even the most seasoned Azure user. To see just how simple this process is with Fathym, check out this video:

### Enterprise Details

With the Frathym Framework, everything starts from your enterprise.  Whether a one man show, or large-scale SI, your enterprise will allow you to create infrastructure, manage devops and deploy applications.  We'll start you on a domain within our control, and provide you the journeys to run on your own domains and even white-label our framework and practices for your end users.

**Workspace Name** Enter the name of the Enterprise Workspace.  Many organization only ever need a single workspace, and this can be named after your company.

**Workspace Lookup** The lookup will be used to identify your Fathym Framework environment, and to uniquely identify and group the resources provisioned.   (Required to contain 3 - 12 charaters, lowercase characters a-z with '-' and numbers 0-9. A '-' may not start or end the value.)

### Azure Connection

Why use Azure to start? and grow to supporting other hybrid clouds?

#### Prerequisites

Before setting up the Fathym Framework you will need to set up a Microsoft account for your organization so Fathym can connect with Microsoft Azure. This way everything you create in Fathym is provisioned in your own Azure infrastructure, meaning you maintain all ownership and we don't lock you in.

Note that Azure charges you incur will be billed back to you. If you are setting up a new Azure account, you will get a $200 credit to use within 30 days, as well as 12 months of many services for free.

:::important

In order to have access to the necessary permissions and settings required for setup in Azure, your Azure account needs to be at the administrator level.
