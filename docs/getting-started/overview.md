# Fathym Account Setup

Fathym Framework enables developers to rapidly build modular and reusable applications by automating best practice workflows for cloud-native application orchestration.

In the getting started guide, we'll walk you through creating an automated, enterprise-grade, Azure-hosted environment with just a few clicks.  Then show you how you can deploy and manage applications across a variety of technologies.  In the initial setup, you'll have to template options.  One for just the application orchestration capabilities and another for the IoT data flow capabilities.  To get the most out of this guide, we recommend start with the IoT template.

To kick things off, register and select a [Starter or Pro](https://www.fathym-it.com/billing/lcu) package, also make sure you have an Azure account and subscription created.  Once registered, we'll help you get everything going.

:::important

In order to have access to the necessary permissions and settings required for setup in Azure, your Azure account needs to be at the administrator level.

## Next Steps

There are a number of ways to leverage your IDE once setup completes, but we recommend you start with our more detailed [try it](getting-started/try-it) introduction.   Here you'll get a look at what's been setup and where the try it journeys will take you.  If your eager to jump in on a specific topic, here's a high level look at where our initial getting started guide will take you.

### Try Micro-Frontends

An application orchestration environment has been setup that will support you in developing your cloud-native solutions.  In this part of the guide, we walk you through deploying and leveraging pre-existing Low Code Units and how to use the Fathym LCU CLI to create and deliver your first micro-frontends (standalone app and IDE blade).
