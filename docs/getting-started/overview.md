# Fathym Account Setup

Fathym Framework enables developers to rapidly build modular and reusable applications by automating best practice workflows for cloud-native application orchestration.

In the getting started guide, in only a few clicks, we'll walk you through creating an automated, enterprise-grade, Azure-hosted environment.  You'll have two template options, one for the application orchestration capabilities and another that also includes IoT data flow capabilities.  To get the most out of this guide and an understanding of the Fathym Framework, we recommend starting with the IoT template (the same tools can be used to achieve vastly different outcomes than IoT).  

Once setup, we'll show you how you can deploy and manage applications across a variety of technologies.  To kick things off, register and select a [Starter or Pro](https://www.fathym-it.com/billing/lcu) package, also make sure you have an [Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) and subscription created.  Once registered, we'll help you get everything going.

:::important

In order to have access to the necessary permissions and settings required for setup in Azure, your Azure account needs to be at the administrator level.

## Next Steps

There are a number of ways to leverage your IDE once setup completes, however we recommend you start with our more detailed [try it](getting-started/try-it) introduction.  If your eager to jump in on a specific topic, here's a high level look at where our initial getting started journeys will take you.

### Micro-Frontends Journey

An application orchestration environment has been setup that will support you in developing your cloud-native solutions.  In this part of the guide, we walk you through deploying and leveraging existing Low Code Units and how to use the Fathym [LCU CLI](developers/applications/cli) to create and deliver your own micro-frontends.

[Try out](getting-started/try-it/micro-frontends) Fathym Framework micro-frontends now.

### IoT Starter Journey

In addition to the application orchestration capabilites, when selecting the IoT Starter template you get a functioning IoT workflow to begin working with.  This will allow you to rapidly support custom data ingest, transform, storage, and visualizations.  Understanding and seeing your data is the first step in a journey towards successful IoT.

### Where to go from here?

If this isn't what your looking to accomplish, once your IDE is ready, you'll be greeted with additional developer journeys to get you going.
