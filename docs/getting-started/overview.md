- Creating your Fathym acccount
  - Enterprise Details Setup
  - Azure Connection
  - Setup Review

For setups that would like a hybrid-cloud without Azure connectivity, please visit [Starting without Azure](guides/starting-without-azure)

## Fathym Account Creation

**Fathym saves you time.** Fathym does the heavy lifting of backend infrastructure and workflow automation so that you don't need to spend time and resources to "level up" and become an expert cloud architect.

After registering for a Starter or Pro package, you can let Fathym do the heavy lifting to:

- Provision an enterprise scalable cloud on your Azure
- Provide best practices in building essential data flows and cloud storage
- Automate DevOp operations with application release/deployment and version management
- Maximize reusability and save time in data application development

Are you an expert cloud architect?  See how our tools can support you in establishing your own [best practices and automation](developers/infrastructure)

### Automating a Best Practice Cloud-Native Environment

With Fathym, you can quickly and easily set up a best practice cloud infrastructure environment for application orchestration and configuring end-to-end Internet of Things (IoT) data flow environments. With just a few clicks, Fathym sets up this infrastructure in your own Azure cloud environment, so it is always accessible and always yours. Users can simply sign into or create an Azure account and retrieve the required keys.

Fathym offers two infrastructure template options. The Low Code Unit Runtime Template installs the Azure resources that are required to run the Fathym Low-Code Framework and host, manage and deploy applications and APIs. The Low Code Unit Runtime Template w/ IoT installs all the above and will provision the infrastructure to connect devices and real-time data flows, enabling IoT projects. This includes the initial best practice data flow resources, like an IoT Hub, Event Hub, Cold Storage, Warm Storage, and Hot Storage.

Having selected the infrastructure template that is right for you, in 15 minutes or less Fathym will automate your enterpriseâ€“ready cloud environment while you kick back and have a beer.

The video below compares configuring these resources in Fathym versus the Azure portal, which is tedious and time consuming for even the most seasoned Azure user. To see just how simple this process is with Fathym, check out this video:
