# Fathym Account Setup

Fathym Framework enables developers to rapidly build data-driven applications by applying best practice workflows for cloud infrastructure automation and application management.

In the getting started guide, we'll walk you through creating an automated, enterprise-grade, Azure-hosted environment with just a few clicks.  Then show you how you can deploy and manage applications across a variety of technologies.  To kick things off, register and select a [Starter or Pro](https://www.fathym-it.com/billing/lcu) package.  Once registered, we'll help you get things setup.

Need help during setup?  Read the following for [support and details](getting-started/enterprise-setup-explained) on the setup process.

## Next Steps

There are a number of ways to leverage your LCU Runtime once setup completes.  If this isn't what your looking to accomplish, once your IDE is ready, you'll be greeted with a number of developer journeys to get you started.

### Try Micro-Frontends

In this part of the guide, we walk you through deploying and leveraging pre-existing Low Code Units and how to use the Fathym LCU CLI to create and deliver your first micro-frontends (standalone app and IDE blade).
