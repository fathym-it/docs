# Fathym Micro-Frontends Journey

While the Fathym Framework can be used with applications of any size, we encourage teams to shift to some level of [micro-frontends](../../developers/applications/micro-frontends) approach.  To get you started in that approach, the [LCU Runtime](../../developers/applications/runtime) provides a number of different ways to organize, secure, and manage applications.

## Deploy Existing LCU Applications

During setup, we started you with a series of applications to boot your environment (IDE and Settings apps).  In addition, we have other applications in the open source that we have already wrapped and prepared for simple use in the Fathym Framework.  In this guide we'll take you through deploying, securing, and accessing open source applicatinos.  

<!-- For information on implementing your favorite open source tools in LCUs for the enterprise, read our guide.  Looking to monetize your work?  Follow this guide on how to leverage Fathym to create paid for offerings. -->

## Deploy LCUs as IDE Blades

When setting up your environment, we went ahead and added a couple of default IDE blades as well.  These blades provide a low code / no code way of orchestrating applications (Application Flow LCU) across domains and leveraging your deployed cloud-native infrastructure (Data Flow LCU).  Here we'll walk you through adding additional blades (Fathym Forecast LCUs) and programming your IDE.

## Customize Existing Applications

The purpose of open source is to provide developers with a leg-up and starting point, either in the form of a fully baked application solution (WordPress), or the framework and foundation by witch to grow from (Docusaurus).

Fork, customize, release... Github setup link, npm setup link, organization setup across both setups... (all one article... maybe exists already)...

## Create Custom LCUs with the CLI

LCUs can be standalone applications of any size, or small building blocks like web components or standalone javascript (see more on micro-frontends design patterns) to compose larger experiences.
