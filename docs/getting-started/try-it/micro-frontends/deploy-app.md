# Deploy Applications

As part of the initial setup process, we configured the Application Flow LCU for you.  This allows you to work with your enterprise applications in a no code way, and make them available on your host.  There are multiple ways to get your application code into the distributed filesystem, here we'll focus on leveraging a publically available package to retrieve the contents of our application and host it on a specific route.  

If you don't see the Application Flow, or for more information on how it was configured read here (the application flow LCU package is @napkin-ide/lcu-data-apps-lcu).
