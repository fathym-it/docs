During Fathym's setup process, we prepared some starting point best practices for your infrastructure, DevOps, and application orchestration (check out our guide, for a [detailed explanation](enterprise-setup-explained)).  This portion of the getting started guide will take you through some of the basics, and proide you some ways to dig in further.

<!-- 
Some context on what was setup... DevOps, Azure resources, LCU Runtime, default micro-apps and pre-conifgured microapps

Summarize where we'll start, what we'll accomplish, and where we'll end...

Deafult apps relate to enterprise whitelabeling -->

## Micro-Frontends Journey

An application orchestration environment has been setup that will support you in developing your cloud-native solutions.  In this part of the guide, we walk you through deploying and leveraging existing Low Code Units and how to use the Fathym [LCU CLI](../developers/applications/cli) to create and deliver your first micro-frontends.

[Try out](try-it/micro-frontends) Fathym Framework micro-frontends now.

### Deploy Existing LCU Applications

### Deploy LCUs as IDE BLades

### Customize Existing Applications

### Create Custom LCUs with the CLI

## IoT Starter Journey

In addition to the application orchestration capabilites, when selecting the IoT starter template you get a functioning IoT workflow to begin working with.  This will allow you to rapidly support custom data ingest, data transform, data storage, and visualization.  Understanding and seeing your data is the first step in a journey towards successful IoT.
