During Fathym's setup process, we prepared some starting point best practices for your infrastructure, DevOps, and application orchestration (check out our guide, for a [detailed explanation](enterprise-setup-explained)).  This portion of the getting started guide will take you through some of the basics, and proide you some ways to dig in further.

<!-- 
Some context on what was setup... DevOps, Azure resources, LCU Runtime, default micro-apps and pre-conifgured microapps

Summarize where we'll start, what we'll accomplish, and where we'll end...

Deafult apps relate to enterprise whitelabeling -->

## What is a Journey?

Throughout the process of working with the Fathym Framework, you will be preseented with journeys that will help guide you through learning new skills and tools to help get your job done.  Journeys are a way for us to organize those efforts, and in the future you will be able to create custom journeys.

## Micro-Frontends Journey

As mentioned, an application orchestration environment has been setup, and the [LCU Runtime](../developers/applications/runtime) will support a release strategy for your cloud-native applications.  In this journey, we'll deploy existing applications and LCUs, customize them and create our own with the Fathym [LCU CLI](../developers/applications/cli).

## IoT Starter Journey

In addition to the application orchestration capabilites, when selecting the IoT starter template you get a functioning IoT workflow to begin working with.  This will allow you to rapidly support custom data ingest, data transform, data storage, and visualization.  Understanding and seeing your data is the first step in a journey towards successful IoT.
