During Fathym's setup process, we prepared some starting point best practices for your infrastructure, DevOps, and application orchestration (check out our guide, for a [detailed explanation](enterprise-setup-explained)).  This portion of the getting started guide will take you through some of the basics, and provide you some ways to dig in further.

<!-- 
Some context on what was setup... DevOps, Azure resources, LCU Runtime, default micro-apps and pre-conifgured microapps

Summarize where we'll start, what we'll accomplish, and where we'll end...

## What is a Journey?

Throughout the process of working with the Fathym Framework, you will be presented with journeys that will help guide you through learning new skills and tools to help get your job done.  Journeys are a way for us to organize those efforts, and in the future you will be able to create custom journeys.

## Micro-Frontends Journey

As mentioned, an application orchestration environment has been setup.  With this, cloud-native infrastructure has been provisioned, some stating point DevOps has been put in place, our [LCU Runtime](../developers/applications/runtime) has been deployed, and a series of LCUs have been configured to get you going on the Fathym Framework.  In this journey, we'll deploy additional applications and LCUs, customize them and create our own with the Fathym [LCU CLI](../developers/applications/cli).

## IoT Starter Journey

If you selected the IoT Starter template, then in addtion to our cloud-native application orchestration capabilities, we also setup additional infrastructure and default LCUs to more rapidly create IoT solutions.  With this infrastructure in place, you can easily support custom data ingest, transform, storage, and visualizations.  Understanding and seeing your data is the first step in a journey towards successful IoT.
