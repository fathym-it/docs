## What does it mean?

Fathym Framework is open source, licensed under the Apache 2.0 license for most of what we do, other aspects of the system are MIT licensed, both of which provide an open future to your use of those repositories.  In these ways, the code you release and/or fork from the open source are yours.  

## Migrating from Fathym Framework

Fathym Framework is also made up of proprietary APIs, data structures, and infrastructure.  This code is leveraged by many of the open source repos, and while your license will grant you access to these APIs, if you decide to move on from Fathym, you will have to backfill these layers of technology.

Most of what you've used our system to build is provisioned in your world, however our layer of Persona APIs will need to be replaced.  Take a deeper dive into [migrating from fathym](../guides/migrating-from-fathym).
