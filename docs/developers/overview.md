Beyond our own API, architecture, and design principals, we also focus on delivering best practices across various styles of programming.  As we grow, we hope the community will help us evolve other architectures as additional best practices to fit the ever evoloving horizon of technology.  In our developer docs, you will not only find solutions to leverage on your next deliverable, but also information on why and how to achieve these same efforts on your own.  Sharing knowledge is the purpose of open source, and we hope to make that knowledge more accesible.
