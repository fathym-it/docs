# Welcome to Fathym Framework

A platform and framework focused on helping you take charge of your hybrid-clouds, applications, and deployment strategies.  

Managing the learning path, usage and growth of cloud-native infrastructure and application development strategies can be a daunting challenge. With the Fathym Framework you can reliably deliver cloud-native applications across hybrid-clouds.  

## Virtual Developer Team

Fathym operates as a virtual developer team that automates best practices for infrastructure and application delivery. We built the framework to augment your teamâ€™s skills and do the heavy lifting so you can focus on building applications and creating value.

The Fathym Framework radically reduces the time and work involved for managing legacy applications, adopting new application delivery strategies ([micro-frontends](developers/applications/micro-frontends), Jamstack, containerization), and bringing [infrastructure](developers/infrastructure) and [DevOps](developers/devops) best practices to bear.
