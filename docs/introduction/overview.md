# Welcome to Fathym Framework

A platform and framework focused on helping you take charge of your hybrid-clouds, applications, and deployment strategies.  

Managing the learning path, usage, and growth of cloud-native technology can be a daunting challenge, with the support of the Fathym Framework you can reliably deliver your next cloud-native applications across hybrid-clouds.  Improve management of legacy applications, adopt new application delivery strategies (micro-frontends, jamstack, and more), and bring infrastructure and DevOps best practices to bear with ease.

**Fathym saves you time** by doing the heavy lifting of backend infrastructure and application management so that you don't need to spend time and resources to "level up" and become an expert cloud architect.
