# What is Fathym Framework?

A framework for delivering cloud-native applications reliably across hybrid-clouds.  

We provide everything you need to deliver your next cloud-native solution.  Start from scratch with out-of-the box functionality, or select the features you need.  Leverage the Fathym Framework to establish your enterprise best practices and deliver solutions with your existing technology skills.

## Best Practices

At its core, Fathym Framework embraces a perspective of "We all do it a little different".  Technology is vast, and our chosen languages and frameworks should make what we do easier.  While our best practices are opinionated towards Azure, C#, and Angular, we recognize that every team is different.  Our framework will help you deliver your best practices repeatably through your infrastructure, devops, and application development decisions.  Whether delivering innovative, startup technology or proven legacy solutions, Fathym Framework will support your team in adopting and establishing best practices in a hybrid-cloud world.

## Community Driven

Open Core and Open Source... We know we don't have all the answers, and it takes a community to shift the way we think about putting together technology solutions

## Low Code Units

Some good copy on what a low code unit is, how they work together to create cohesive end user experiences, and the shift in design practice...

Our frontend development practices/architectures are known as Low Code Units.  We embrace component driven, state driven, atomic reusability in what we offer...

## Virtual Developers

Different than most low code/no code platforms, Fathym helps you develop repeatable automation on your own chosen technology stack.  Our virtual developers can be programmed to deliver the tech you choose, in a repeatable, migratable, and scalable way.  Enable Jr and Mid level devs to deliver with Sr dev quality, even enabling non-development employment roles to accomplish complex development / technology tasks.

## No Vendor Lock-In

Because our virtual developers are always heling your team develop code under enterprise best practice standards, and not just locking your best practices away in our config.  Most of the code, solutions and components you use require little if any vendor lock...
