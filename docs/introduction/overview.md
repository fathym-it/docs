# Welcome to Fathym Framework

A platform and framework focused on helping you take charge of your hybrid-clouds, cloud-native applications, and deployment strategies.  

Managing the learning path, usage and growth of cloud-native infrastructure and application development strategies can be a daunting challenge. With the Fathym Framework you can reliably deliver cloud-native applications across hybrid-clouds.  

## Virtual Development Team

Fathym operates as a virtual development team that automates best practices for infrastructure and application delivery. In order to help you focus on building applications and creating value, we built the framework to augment your teamâ€™s skills and do your heavy lifting.

The Fathym Framework radically reduces the time and work involved in managing legacy applications, adopting new application delivery strategies ([micro-frontends](developers/applications/micro-frontends), Jamstack, cloud-native), and bringing [infrastructure](developers/infrastructure) and [DevOps](developers/devops) best practices to bear.
