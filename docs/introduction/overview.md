# Welcome to Fathym Framework

A platform and framework focused on helping you take charge of your hybrid-clouds, applications, and deployment strategies.  

Managing the learning path, usage, and growth of cloud-native technology and application development strategies can be a daunting challenge, with the support of the Fathym Framework you can reliably deliver your next cloud-native applications across hybrid-clouds.  Improve management of legacy applications, adopt new application delivery strategies ([micro-frontends](developers/applications/micro-frontends), jamstack, containerization, and more), and bring [infrastructure](developers/infrastructure) and [DevOps](developers/devops) best practices to bear with ease.
